### 9. Add CDN live broadcast function, and this function supports push-pull streaming using QUIC protocol

Retweet CDN: Retweet CDN refers to the process of pushing audio and video streams from ZEGO audio and video cloud to ZEGO's own CDN or third-party CDN.

Direct push CDN: Developers can directly push audio and video streams to CDN by specifying the URL of a specific CDN (or using ZEGO backend configuration), which needs to be set before pushing.

QUIC protocol push-pull streaming: It is mainly used to improve the unstable quality of CDN live streaming in weak network environment, but the improvement is limited. It is recommended to use low-latency live streaming to enjoy high-quality and low-latency live streaming services. Currently, QUIC protocol push and pull streaming using Tencent and Wangsu's two CDN live streaming products are supported.

The push protocol and QUIC version are configured through the "ZegoCDNConfig" parameter in the [enablePublishDirectToCDN] interface. If you want to perform a custom CDN streaming of the QUIC protocol, you need to configure the pull protocol and QUIC version through the "ZegoPlayerConfig" parameter in [startPlayingStream].

For related APIs, please refer to addPublishCdnUrl, removePublishCdnUrl, enablePublishDirectToCDN

### 10. Added [setPlayStreamVideoType] interface to set the video stream type to play

When the pusher sets the "codecID" to "SVC" through [setVideoConfig] (it can be set before and after the puller), the puller can dynamically set and select different stream types (the small resolution is the half of the standard layer) one). When the network is weak or the rendered UI form is small, you can choose to use the low-resolution video to save bandwidth.

For related APIs, please refer to setPlayStreamVideoType
